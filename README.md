To extract and run the file you need the password of the zip file. The application and sample images can only be used for research and development purposes. For the password contact chayan.halderz@gmail.com with the reason for use and with proper affiliation.<br>

To run the exe, you need to use the command feature_extration_Content_Independent.exe <filename\> in command prompt. You can use batch to do the same repetitively. In the generated feature file, the last two columns are the index of the writer and then the set number of the writer. The inputted files names should be similar to the sample test filenames otherwise the writer index and set number values would not be generated.<br><br>
Anyone using this exe for academic/research (purely non-profit, non-commercial) purpose need to cite the following during reporting their works:<br>
